==== 2.0
The reasons it's 2.0 and not 1.2
* File list is now case insensitive.
* Changed usermanager to javabeans (use UserManagerConverter to convert).
* Dropped slaves.xml, use site [add|del]slave etc. commands.
* Changed keys in .properties formatting, now using dynamic user data as keys.
* Added symlinks.
* Dropped RMI in favor of our own master<->slave protocol which will scale
  much better.
In progress:
* Dropped glob-style path permissions in favor of ants pattern path expressions.
