* XML BASED CONFIGURATION

* More fine grained file-permissions?
	Current permission style:
		- Can delete if is file owner or isAdmin().
		- Can always create anywhere.

* SITE NUKE
	Issue:
		What if a slave is disconnected when nuke:ing?
	Possible Solution:
		Keep a backlog of all renames and make sure that
		returning slaves go through the backlog?
	Solution:
		Queued deletes.

* SITE UNNUKE
	Issue:
		Needs to get multiplier.
	Possible solution:
		nukelog:
		keep the value in LinkedRemoteFile and save to files.xml

* sitebot
	Issue:
		Needs to communicate with drftpd
	Possible solution:
		java based irc bot.
		eggdrop communicating over tcp.

* PASV - passive transfer mode

* Native user storage, not some glftpd hack...

* recheck content on slaves to automatically add new files/remove
  deleted files.
	Issue:
		Latency/load, reloading the site contents from disk
		is time consuming and loads the disks. It possibly
		overloads the slave too.
	Possible Solution:
		- Recursively check entire site and call sleep() often.
		- Check one directory at a time and sync directly to the
		  LinkedRemoteFile tree.
		- Restart slave and make sure slave is unmerge()'d before.

* Automatically delete/move files when diskspace is getting low.

* redundant masters

* Queued deletes/renames:
	Issues:
		Remove files from LinkedRemoteFile tree?
		Or implememnt isDeleted() or exists()?
		Make lookupFile() throw NoSuchFileExistsException on deleted files?
	needed fields:
		deletes:	path
		renames:	from, to
