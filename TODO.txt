* XML BASED CONFIGURATION

* More fine grained file-permissions?
	Current permission style:
		- Can delete if is file owner or isAdmin().
		- Can always create anywhere.

* SITE NUKE
	Issue:	
		What if a slave is disconnected when nuke:ing?
	Possible Solution:
		Keep a backlog of all renames and make sure that
		returning slaves go through the backlog?

* recheck content on slaves to automatically add new files/remove
  deleted files.
	Issue:
		Latency/load, reloading the site contents from disk
		is time consuming and loads the disks. It possibly
		overloads the slave too.
	Solution:
		- Recursively check entire site and call sleep() often.
		- Check one directory at a time and sync directly to the
		  LinkedRemoteFile tree.

* Make RemoteFile an interface and make RemoteFileTree extends RemoteFile
	for adding the possibility of extending other classes such as
	RMI.

* Automatically delete/move files when diskspace is getting low.
