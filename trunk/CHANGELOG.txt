* Fixed minor bugs.

2007/01/09 fr0w <fr0w@users.sourceforge.net>
* Fixed a problem while renaming users that where currently connected.

2007/01/08 fr0w <fr0w@users.sourceforge.net>
* Code clean-up! Bye bye Java 1.4! Welcome Generics! (lol)

* Documenting VFS API.
* Fixed TimeEventManager TestCase to work w/ all Locales.

2007/01/06 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Adding TimeEventInterface (cron-like scheduling).
  It can execute commands hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly.
  Check codes for more details.

2007/01/02 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Happy new year! Happy new *STABLE* FS!
* From this date on the VFS should be marked as stable!

2006/12/28 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* remerge() implemented, boosted speed and reduce the memory footprint during this proccess.

2006/12/21 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Fixed Rename routine.

2006/12/16 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Huge code clean-up targeting all non-compilable code.
  Core from now will only contain essential code, a proper
  plugin interface is needed.
  
2006/10/19 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Fixed a bug that could slow down ActiveConnection.
  Code was trying to resolve dns's  w/o the need to.
  
2006/06/16 fr0w <fr0w@users.sourceforge.net>
* Add support for SSL slave-to-slave transfers issued by JobManager.

2006/04/03 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Added the possibilitie to select which cipher suites you are going to use.
  Check drftpd.conf and slave.conf for more details.
  
2006/03/25 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Attempt to make transfer work, there's should be some errors since there's
  no remerge() method yet.
  
2006/03/18 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Implementing few commands so that we can *actually* use the VFS
  Listing, deleting, renaming, changing dirs should now be working.
  Transfer aren't ready yet.
* Diferent InodeHandle implementations to handle Links/Dirs/Files,
  getting rid of poor checking when trying to use LinkedRemoteFile
  isFile()/isDir()/isLink(), from now on it all based on hierarchy
  and types.

2006/03/12 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Intregation w/ the new VFS and the daemon, still have lot of work to do.
  Lowest levels of the VFS are no longer accessed, InodeHandles *SHOULD* be
  the unique way to reference them.

2006/02/20 Matt Zimmerman <zubov@users.sourceforge.net>
* Started the implementation of the new VFS.
