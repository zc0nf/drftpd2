* How is it possible to interrupt a read() request so we can shutdown a
	FtpConnection Thread ?
	- thread.interrupt() has no effect
	- outputstream.close() blocks until the read() call has finished.
	! how will this work with stale connections?

* More fine grained file-permissions?
	Current permission style:
		- Can delete if is owner or isAdmin().
		- Can always create.
