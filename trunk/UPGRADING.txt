UPGRADING

Replace classes/ and src/, update all .conf files with new or changed 
directives found in the correlating .dist files
Especially make sure commandhandlers.conf gets updated as new commands 
won't be recognized if commandhandlers.conf isn't up-to-date.

1.1.4 --> 2.0
run bin/xstream2beans.sh before starting the daemon
* When converting from 1.1.4 xstream userdb, the xstream libs included
  with 1.1.4 have slightly different serialized formats,
  recent xstream escapes _ in field names as __.
  You can use this code snippet to upgrade them so that they are readable
  by recent xstream versions.
  > for x in *.xml ; do sed -e 's/<_/<__/' \
    -e 's/<\/_/<\/__/' $x > $x- ; mv $x- $x ; done

rm slaves.xml (you will need to create them again, described in MAJORCHANGES.txt)

delete files.mlst(don't worry, it will be recreated)
